# Congratulations on getting through the first section of the course
# Now we will put these skills into practice by implementing a game of tic tac toe
# You have all skills necessary to implement it from SCRATCH! That's right, no starter code.
# You are free to use features not yet covered such as classes, however they are not necessary
# The only requirements is two users are able to play a game of tic tac toe
# This project will not have a solution - you are able to do this. I believe in you!
