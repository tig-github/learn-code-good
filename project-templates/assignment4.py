# Fantastic, you have covered all the introductory concepts in programming!
# Recursion is very difficult, it is normal to struggle with it. In many curriculum it is taught
# a while later, but strong skills and understanding of recursion is fundemental and valuable enough to teach sooner.
# following specifications, make sure to fill out each function.


# Specify parameters and create functionality for a function that
# adds an indeterminant amount of numbers, with at least 2
# handle ValueErrors
# Example inputs:
# calculator_add(1, 2, 3, 4)
# calculator_add(1, 2)
def calculator_add():
    pass 


# Specify parameters and create functionality for a function that
# subtracts an indeterminant amount of numbers, with at least 2
# handle ValueErrors
def calculator_subtract():
    pass 


# Specify parameters and create functionality for a function that
# multiplies 2 numbers - you may NOT use the * operator and you may NOT use loops
# you will use recursion for repitition instead
# Don't worry about handling 0
# handle ValueErrors
def calculator_multiply():
    pass 

# Specify parameters and create functionality for a function that
# takes the first number to the power of the second number - WITHOUT using ** operator and NO loops
# you will use recursion for repitition instead
# you are not expected to handle negative numbers
# handle ValueErrors
def calculator_power():
    pass


# Specify parameters and create functionality for a function that
# divides 2 numbers - it must have a keyword argument set to False that returns
# the remainder instead of the quotient, and a keyword argument set to False that
# returns integer division instead of float division
# Example inputs:
# calculator_divide(3, 2) = 1.5
# calculator_divide(3, 2, remainder=True) = 1
# calculator_divide(5, 3, integer=True) = 2
# handle ValueErrors
def calculator_divide(x, y):
    pass
