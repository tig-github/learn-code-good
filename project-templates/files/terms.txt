Hello there. I am going to be writing a lot of random nonsense for this terms txt file. Instead of getting one online
for whatever reason I decided to write one out. 124124214124214124124124. Anyway.... this is going to test    multiple spaces
stacked on top of each other. This file does not require splitting on punctuation or other non alphanumeric characters. That will be
taught in depth later when we go over RegEx. RegEx are a really cool, powerful tool that has a lot of roots in the 
theory of computation.
